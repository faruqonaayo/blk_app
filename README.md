## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Flutter — cross-platform mobile UI  
- SQLite — local, offline-first storage (sqflite or equivalent)  
- Firebase — authentication and optional cloud sync/backups

## 🚀 Getting Started (try these)
Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed  
- Platform tooling (Android Studio/Xcode) or device for testing  
- Firebase project (for auth and optional sync)

Quick setup (copy-paste)
```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd blk_app
flutter pub get
# add Firebase config files to platforms (GoogleService-Info.plist / google-services.json)
flutter run
```

Tips
- Open DevTools: flutter pub global run devtools (for debugging UI/state) 🧭  
- Use an emulator/device for camera/file attachments testing 📸

## 💾 Local DB
- SQLite is used for local persistence. Migrations and seed data live under the data layer: /lib/data.  
- App works offline by default; cloud sync via Firebase is optional and must handle conflict resolution.

## 🧭 Project Structure (high level)
- lib/  
    - main.dart — app entry

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Next steps
- 📈 Improve dashboard analytics and visualizations  
- 🖼️ Add image attachments for items  
- 🔁 Implement background sync and conflict resolution  
- 👥 Role-based access / sharing inventories for business users
